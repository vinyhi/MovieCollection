The MovieCollection project serves as a backend system designed for managing a collection of movie data. It leverages the efficiency of the Gin framework for server setup and handling HTTP requests, and connects to a MongoDB database for persistent storage. The configuration is flexibly managed through environment variables, ensuring sensitive data is kept secure. Additionally, it incorporates middleware for parsing JSON requests, streamlining the interaction with frontend applications. A dedicated module, `movieRoutes`, is used for routing and handling all movie-related API requests. This setup empowers the backend to efficiently process and respond to requests, making the MovieCollection project a robust solution for movie data management.
